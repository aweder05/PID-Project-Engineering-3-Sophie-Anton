# PID Project Engineering 3 
# The Banana of Doom 

### Project Idea

Since we were unable to completely finish our last project, we decided that we would choose a simple PID project. This was also because PID was a completely new concept to use, and because we knew that it would take up a lot of our time to find a basis of understanding for PID and how to apply that to our coding and all other aspects of our project. Therefore, we decided to do the following: create a box with a TT-Motor on the inside, which spins a mini-banana on the outside. This would then be read by a photointerruptor in terms of rotations per minute. Then this value would be displayed on the front of our box using a Liquid Crystal Display. The entire box would be powered by a 9-Volt battery back, with an on switch and a corresponding LED to signify if our box was switched on or not. 
## Proposed Project Schedule  

Attached below is a table of our week-to-week goals, and what we would like to get done in that time.
The most likely outcome is that we will probably need more time for some things, and less time for others. 

| **Week / Day**       | **To-Do**            |

## CAD Design for PID Project

We knew that we needed to choose a simple project to make it so that we wouldn't have to cram in everything all at once near the end of our project. That was reflected in the way we approached our CAD design, as we opted for a simple T-Slot box with all the electronic elements on the inside. The only slightly-challenging element of our CAD Design process was making sure that there was enough space for everything, especially since we knew that we would need plenty of space for all of the wiring for the LCD, LED, Adafruit Metro, Switch, TT-Motor, and finally the Photointerruptor. In the end, reflecting on what we could have probably done better, it might have been smart to make the box a little bigger in order to allow for better ease if access while wiring.
